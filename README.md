# Hi there, I'm Elvis ðŸ‘‹  

 **Technologist | Software Engineer | Builder of Cool Things**  

I'm passionate about creating scalable, secure, and user-friendly software that makes an impact.  
Currently on a journey to become one of the best technologists in the world by delivering quality software. I believe great technology is built on three pillars: security, scalability, and user experience. Every project I take on is guided by those principles.
I thrive in environments where I can solve problems, learn fast, and collaborate with people who dream big.
